AI Training Data Preparation System

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to help an AI developer overcome challenges related to preparing training data for their AI models. The developer uses web scraping to collect data but faces issues with data categorization and bias detection. This document outlines the requirements for creating a system that ensures the training data is well-organized, balanced, and free from biases.

1. Functional Requirements
1.1 Separate Questions and Answers
Description: The system must separate questions and answers in the training data to allow developers to focus on self-affirmation and validation.

Acceptance Criteria:

Questions and answers are stored in separate files or databases.

Developers can easily access questions and answers independently.

The separation is clearly documented for future reference.

1.2 Categorize Training Data
Description: The system must categorize training questions based on predefined criteria (e.g., topic, difficulty level).

Acceptance Criteria:

Questions are categorized into topics such as "Mathematics," "Science," "History," etc.

Each question is tagged with a difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).

Categories and tags are consistent across the dataset.

1.3 Detect and Mitigate Biases
Description: The system must detect biases in the training data and provide mechanisms to mitigate them.

Acceptance Criteria:

A bias detection tool is integrated into the data pipeline.

The tool identifies biases such as gender, racial, or cultural biases.

Strategies for bias mitigation (e.g., data augmentation, re-sampling) are implemented and documented.

1.4 Verify Data Balance
Description: The system must verify that the training data is balanced across different categories and tags.

Acceptance Criteria:

A report or dashboard is available to visualize data balance.

Data balance is verified before model training.

Developers can adjust the dataset to ensure balance if needed.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
2.1 Performance
Description: The system must process large datasets efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system can handle datasets with up to 1 million records.

Data processing tasks (e.g., categorization, bias detection) are completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 1 hour for large datasets).

2.2 Usability
Description: The system must be easy to use for developers.

Acceptance Criteria:

Clear documentation is provided for all features.

Developers can easily access and modify the dataset.

The system provides intuitive interfaces for data visualization and reporting.

2.3 Scalability
Description: The system must be scalable to accommodate future growth.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system can handle increasing amounts of data without significant performance degradation.

New categories and tags can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

3. Assumptions
Data Source: The training data is collected through web scraping and is available in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Bias Detection: The bias detection tool will use predefined criteria to identify biases (e.g., gender, racial, cultural).

Developer Expertise: The developers using the system have basic knowledge of data processing and AI model training.

4. Validation Plan
Client Review: The requirements will be reviewed with the client to ensure they meet their needs.

Testing: Each feature will be tested to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria.

Unit Testing: Individual components (e.g., categorization, bias detection) will be tested.

Integration Testing: The entire system will be tested to ensure all components work together.

Feedback Loop: Regular feedback will be collected from the developers using the system to make improvements.

5. Prioritization of Tasks
High Priority:
Separate Questions and Answers.
Categorize Training Data.

Medium Priority:
Detect and Mitigate Biases.
Verify Data Balance.

Low Priority:
Documentation and Guidelines.
