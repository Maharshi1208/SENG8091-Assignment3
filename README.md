AI Training Data Preparation and Categorization System
________________________________________
Description
The AI Training Data Preparation and Categorization System is designed to help AI developers organize, categorize, and validate training data for machine learning models. The system ensures that training data is well-structured, free from biases, and easy to use. Key features include:
•	Separation of questions and answers for self-affirmation tasks.
•	Categorization of data into predefined topics and difficulty levels.
•	Detection and mitigation of biases in the training data.
•	Verification of data balance across categories.
________________________________________
Acceptance Criteria
1.	Data Separation:
o	Questions and answers are stored in separate files or tables.
o	The data format follows a predefined structure (e.g., JSON, CSV, SQL).
o	A script is available to organize unstructured data into the required format.
2.	Bias Detection:
o	An algorithm detects and reports biased data.
o	A log file or UI dashboard displays flagged issues.
o	Manual review and correction of flagged data are supported.
3.	Data Categorization:
o	Data is organized into predefined categories (e.g., "Mathematics," "Science").
o	Redundant or unnecessary data is filtered out.
o	A logging mechanism tracks failures during data processing.
4.	Uniform Data Structure:
o	A common schema is defined and documented for all datasets.
o	Existing datasets are reformatted to follow the schema.
o	New data adheres to the standardized format.
5.	GitHub Issue Management:
o	All tasks have clearly defined issues in the GitHub repository.
o	Issues are assigned appropriate labels (e.g., bug, enhancement).
o	Tasks are organized into a Kanban board with To Do, In Progress, and Done statuses.

Assumptions
1.	The training data is accessible and available in a structured or semi-structured format.
2.	Developers have the necessary tools and permissions to access and modify the data.
3.	Predefined structures and categories for data organization are agreed upon and documented.
4.	The bias detection criteria are clearly defined and validated with the client.
________________________________________
Validation Plan
1.	Data Separation:
o	Verify that questions and answers are stored in separate files/tables.
o	Ensure the data format adheres to the predefined structure (e.g., JSON, CSV).
o	Test the script to confirm it organizes unstructured data correctly.
2.	Bias Detection:
o	Test the algorithm with known biased and unbiased datasets to ensure accuracy.
o	Verify that the log file or UI dashboard accurately displays flagged issues.
o	Ensure there is a clear process for manual review and correction of flagged data.
3.	Data Categorization:
o	Confirm that data is correctly organized into predefined categories.
o	Ensure redundant or unnecessary data is filtered out.
o	Test the logging mechanism to confirm it tracks failures accurately.
4.	Uniform Data Structure:
o	Verify that the common schema is clearly defined and documented.
o	Ensure existing datasets are reformatted to follow the schema.
o	Confirm that new data adheres to the standardized format.
5.	GitHub Issue Management:
o	Verify that all tasks have clearly defined issues in the GitHub repository.
o	Ensure issues are assigned appropriate labels (e.g., bug, enhancement).
o	Confirm tasks are organized into a Kanban board with To Do, In Progress, and Done statuses.
